# monospheres
This is the directory containing code for the Monospheres mapping and exploration pipeline, along with a custom version of the OpenVINS package modified for compatibility with the MRS system.
To run the MonoSpheres method example, run ''monospheres/tmux_scripts/fireworld_monospheres/tmux.sh''.
To run the OctoMap mapper and random explorer approach used as baseline in the paper, run ''monospheres/tmux_scripts/fireworld_monospheres/tmux.sh''.

To run both of these scripts, it is first needed to install the MRS sytem and build the packages in this repository. Please follow these instructions:
